# Notebooks

Here you can find the accompanying notebooks for the lecture:

Case Studies to demonstrate the workflow:
* Titanic_Notebook_Overview_DataScience_and_MachineLearning: Overview of Data Science and Machine Learning tasks on a well-known use case.
* Lecture 3 Explorative Analytics on the use case "Top Internet Movie database movies"
* Lecture 6 Unsupervised Learning: notebooks for detecting Anomalies and Clustering as well as Market Basket Analysis.
* Lecture 7: Supervised Learning methods and visualization for classification on the exemplary use case of Iris flowers
* Lecture 7: Supervised Learning methods and visualization for regression
* Lecture 7: Supervised Learning on the exemplary use case ambulant or stationary treatment in a hospital.
* Lecture 9: Image classification with Convolutional neural networks (CNN) on the exemplary use case Fashion MNIST
* Lecture 10: Image classification with CNN and Transfer Learning on the exemplary use case detect Malaria in cells.
* Lecture 11: Background Information on recurrent neural networks on the case study translating text and generating Taylor Swift lyrics
