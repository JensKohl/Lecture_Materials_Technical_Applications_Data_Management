# Lecture Technical Applications Data Management
Slides and notebooks from the lecture held at Fresenius University of Applied Sciences, Munich, Germany.

## Course Description
The lecture's name is a remainder from previous years and does not really cover the current topics and contents of the course...

The course is a 13-week long introduction into Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with more focus on practical than theoretical parts.

Through case studies, several programming excercises and a final project as individual homework, the students learn to to code their own analyses and AI models via Python and Python libraries such as Pandas, SciKit-Learn, Keras/ Tensorflow on Google Colabs.

All content (currently) in German.

The materials will be continuously updated to keep on track with the fast moving research.

Feedback regarding errors, mistakes or improvements highly appreciated... :-)
